# Agent System

This folder contains agent definitions and reusable skills for a state-driven workflow.

Start here:
- `states.md` — state machine and exit criteria
- `repo.profile.md` — repo-specific configuration (edit per repo)
- `skills/work-item-create/templates/work-item.template.md` — work item template (single source of truth)

Skills:
- `skills/document-lifecycle` — where artifacts live and how they are named
- `skills/cross-repo-contract` — template for multi-repo coordination
- `skills/work-item-create` — creating a new work item shell
