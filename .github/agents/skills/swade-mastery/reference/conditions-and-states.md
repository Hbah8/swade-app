# Conditions & States Reference

> All character conditions, wound tracking, and recovery rules.

---

## Shaken (Шок)

- Can only take free actions (including movement and running)
- At start of turn: free Spirit check to recover
  - Failure: still Shaken
  - Success: recover, act normally
- Spend a Benny: instant recovery (even during enemy's turn)
- If already Shaken and take Shaken again → gain **1 Wound** (stay Shaken)

---

## Wounds (Ранения)

- Wild Cards: max **3 Wounds** before Incapacitated (modified by Size/Edges)
- Extras: **1 Wound** = out of action
- Each Wound → **−1** to Pace (min 1) and **all trait checks** (max penalty −3)
- Multiple hits in same turn: resolve each damage roll sequentially

---

## Incapacitated (При смерти)

When a Wild Card takes a 4th+ Wound → Incapacitated. Immediate **Vigor check**:
- Critical Failure: death
- Failure: permanent injury (Injury Table 2d6) + Bleeding Out
- Success: temporary injury (heals when all wounds healed)
- Raise: temporary injury (heals in 24h or when wounds healed)

**Bleeding Out**: Vigor check at start of each turn. Failure = death. Success = survive (repeat next turn). Raise = stabilized. Allies can stabilize with a **Healing** check (action).

---

## Soak Roll (Проверка на прочность)

Spend a Benny → **Vigor check**. Success and each Raise reduces incoming wounds by 1. Success also removes Incapacitation if at least 1 wound soaked.

---

## Stunned (Оглушён)

- Distracted + Vulnerable + falls prone
- Cannot move or act
- Not counted for Gang Up
- Recovery: Vigor check (free action) at start of turn
  - Success: no longer Stunned but Vulnerable until end of next turn
  - Raise: Vulnerable ends at end of current turn

---

## Distracted (Отвлечён)

**−2** to all trait checks until end of next turn.

## Vulnerable (Уязвим)

All trait checks **against** this character get **+2** until end of next turn. Does not stack with Surprise bonus (use highest).

---

## Bound & Entangled (Обездвижен и Схвачен)

- **Entangled (Схвачен)**: cannot move, Vulnerable
- **Bound (Обездвижен)**: cannot move, Distracted + Vulnerable, can only attempt to break free
- Break free: Strength (−2) or Athletics check. Bound → Entangled on success, free on Raise. Entangled → free on success.

Two levels before Incapacitation:
1. **Fatigued** (Утомлён): −1 to all trait checks
2. **Exhausted** (Истощён): −2 to all trait checks
