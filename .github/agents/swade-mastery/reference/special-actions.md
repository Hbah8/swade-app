# Special Actions Reference

> All special combat maneuvers and actions available to characters.

## Defense (Оборона)

+4 to Parry, uses entire turn (no Multi-Action), can move but not run. Lasts until next turn.

---

## Aim (Прицеливание)

Spend entire turn aiming at a specific target. Next turn's first action: ignore up to 4 points of penalties (range, cover, called shot, silhouette, speed) **OR** add +2 to check. Must remain stationary.

---

## Called Shots (Прицельные атаки)

| Target | Penalty | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Head / vitals | −4 | +4 damage |
| Hand | −4 | Can disarm |
| Limb | −2 | No extra effect |
| Object | varies | By silhouette table |
| Armor gap | varies | Ignores armor on that area |

## Wild Attack (Яростный удар)

+2 to Fighting and damage for the entire turn. Character becomes **Vulnerable** until end of next turn. Cannot combine with Desperate Attack.

---

## Desperate Attack (Отчаянный удар)

Choose +2 or +4 to Fighting. Subtract the same amount from damage. Cannot combine with Wild Attack.

---

## Grapple (Захват)

Opposed **Athletics** check. Success = Entangled. Raise = Bound. Attacker is Vulnerable while holding target Bound. Size difference: attacker subtracts silhouette difference from roll. Generally cannot grapple targets 2+ sizes larger.

---

## Push (Толчок)

Opposed **Strength** check. Success = push 1" back. Raise = push 2". Double distance if attacker's silhouette is larger. Pushed target: Athletics check (−2 on Raise) or fall prone. Running 2"+ before push = +2 to check.

---

## Trick (Уловка)

Describe action → choose appropriate skill → opposed check vs target's linked attribute. Success: target becomes **Distracted or Vulnerable** (attacker's choice). Raise: also Shaken or additional narrative effect. Repeated tricks get escalating penalties.

---

## Support (Помощь)

Spend an action, pass trait check → +1 to an ally's next roll (+2 on Raise). Critical Failure: −2 penalty. Max support bonus: **+4** (except Strength checks: unlimited).

---

## Disarm (Обезоруживание)

Called shot to hand/weapon → if hit, damage check vs object. If target is Shaken/Wounded on hand hit: Strength check (−2 hand, −4 wrist) or drop weapon.

---

## Suppressive Fire (Огонь на подавление)

Medium Blast Template, 3× ammo cost, −2 Recoil. Single Shooting die + Wild Die. Success = Distracted. Raise = hit (no bonus damage). Max hits = Rate of Fire.
